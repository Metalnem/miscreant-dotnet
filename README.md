> The best crypto you've never heard of, brought to you by [Phil Rogaway]

[Phil Rogaway]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Rogaway

C# implementation of **Miscreant**: Advanced symmetric encryption library
which provides the [AES-SIV] ([RFC 5297]), [AES-PMAC-SIV], and [STREAM]
constructions. These algorithms are easy-to-use (or rather, hard-to-misuse)
and support encryption of individual messages or message streams.

[AES-SIV]: https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/wiki/AES-SIV
[RFC 5297]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5297
[AES-PMAC-SIV]: https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/wiki/AES-PMAC-SIV
[STREAM]: https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/wiki/STREAM

**AES-SIV** provides [nonce-reuse misuse-resistance] (NRMR): accidentally
reusing a nonce with this construction is not a security catastrophe,
unlike it is with more popular AES encryption modes like [AES-GCM].
With **AES-SIV**, the worst outcome of reusing a nonce is an attacker
can see you've sent the same plaintext twice, as opposed to almost all other
AES modes where it can facilitate [chosen ciphertext attacks] and/or
full plaintext recovery.

For more information, see the [toplevel README.md].

for API documentation.

## Security Notice

This library has not undergone a thorough security audit, and though it makes
an effort to use constant time operations throughout its implementation, actual
constant time behavior has not been verified.
 
Use this library at your own risk.

## Requirements

This library is targeting .NET Standard 2.0. It was tested on .NET Framework 4.7.1
and .NET Core 2.1.2, but it should also work on any of the following platforms:

- .NET Framework 4.6.1
- .NET Core 2.0
- Mono 5.4
- Xamarin.iOS 10.14
- Xamarin.Mac 3.8
